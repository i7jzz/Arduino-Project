Detailed System Description: 
In this project we used:
•	Arduino Mega 2560 
•	4 Channel Relay Module 5V
•	HC-05 Bluetooth Module
•	Bulb
•	Natural Electricity from Home
•	Arduino IDE
First, we connected the HC-05 Bluetooth Module to the Arduino like this.
•	HC-05 Bluetooth Module >> Arduino 
•	VCC >> 3.3V 
•	GND >> GND
•	TXD >> RX0
•	RXD >> TX0 

Second, we connected the 4 Channel Relay Module 5V to the Arduino as well like this.
•	4 Channel Relay Module 5V >> Arduino 
•	GND >> GND
•	IN1 >> PWM 2
•	IN2 >> PWM 3
•	IN3 >> PWM 4
•	IN4 >> PWM 5
•	VCC >> 5V 
Third, we connected the Bulb to the 4 Channel Relay Module 5V.
We connected the pin of the bulb to Normally open and commonly open.
Finally, we used an application on Android called Arduino Bluetooth controller,
Once you download the app, open it and the Bluetooth module HC-05 should be there Click on it and it should be connected to the phone now, now click on the HC-05 icon on the app the interface should be displays like this:
 
Figure 1: user-interface of the app. // on the WirelessProject.pdf file 

You should control of multiple things.
In our project we only program it to turn on/off the bulbs, you could modify on the code to have full access of all the features the app has.
 
Figure 2: On/Off Buttons. // on the WirelessProject.pdf file 
Here you should have control of the bulbs wirelessly, in our project as we said earlier, we only connect 2 bulbs on the 4 channel relay module, you can connect all 4 channel it should work fine.
